Airpod
======

This is a [balena][balena-io] application you can deploy to your
[Raspberry Pi][raspberry] and turn it to an [AirPlay][airplay] target that
can stream audio to any Hi-Fi setup via the analogue output.

Under the hood, it uses the excellent [shairport-sync][shairport-sync] project.

Requirements
------------

- A Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
- An analogue audio setup such as an amplifier and speakers
- Appropriate analogue Mini-jack to RCA or Phono cable

You can then target this setup and stream audio from any AirPlay-capable
device, version either 1 or 2 (most iOS, tvOS and macOS devices)


Installation
------------

**IMPORTANT**: The Raspberry Pi will send a loud click out its analogue output
when the audio device is started or shut down. That usually means, the first
time an AirPlay client connects and starts streaming and on reboot or shutdown.
Watch out or this can fry your equipment.

Clone this repository locally to your computer:

    $ git clone https://github.com/balena-io-playground/airpod.git

Follow the [Getting Started guide][getting-started] to provision your device
and deploy this project with Resin.io.

### Configuration

Use the [Dashboard][dashboard] to configure the app.

On the "Environment Variables" page, add the following entry:

  - `AIRPOD_PASSWORD`: a password that should be provided by clients targeting this
    device for playback.

  - `AIRPORD_DEVICE_NAME`: a name that is dicoverable by clients targeting this
    device for playback.

That's it. After a few seconds, the device will advertise itself as an Airplay
target under its name. You can change the device name from the Dashboard.
